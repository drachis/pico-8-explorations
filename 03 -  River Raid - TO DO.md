Creating a clone of River Raid in Pico-8 involves breaking down the game into manageable modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the game. Below is a detailed breakdown of these modules along with their functionalities and interactions:

### 1. Player Module
**Description**: Handles the player's jet fighter, including movement, shooting, and collisions.

**Features**:
- **Jet Movement**: Allow the jet to move left and right, accelerate, and brake.
- **Jet Animation**: Animate the jet sprite for a smoother visual experience.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Enable the jet to shoot projectiles.
- **Collision Detection**: Check for collisions with river banks, enemies, and bridges.

**Functions**:
- `init_jet()`: Initialize the jet's position, speed, and other properties.
- `update_jet()`: Update the jet's position based on player input.
- `draw_jet()`: Render the jet on the screen.
- `shoot()`: Handle shooting logic.
- `check_collisions()`: Check for and handle collisions with other objects.

### 2. Environment Module
**Description**: Manages the river, river banks, and procedural generation of the levels.

**Features**:
- **River Generation**: Procedurally generate the river with varying widths and splits.
- **River Bank Collisions**: Detect collisions with the river banks.
- **Level Transitions**: Manage transitions between levels and the placement of bridges.

**Functions**:
- `init_environment()`: Initialize the environment settings.
- `update_environment()`: Update the river and other environmental elements.
- `draw_environment()`: Render the river and its banks.
- `generate_river()`: Procedurally generate the river segments.

### 3. Enemy Module
**Description**: Handles the creation, movement, and behavior of enemies like boats, helicopters, and jets.

**Features**:
- **Enemy Movement**: Move enemies across the screen based on predefined patterns.
- **Enemy Spawning**: Spawn enemies at intervals or based on level progression.
- **Enemy Collisions**: Detect collisions with the player and projectiles.

**Functions**:
- `init_enemies()`: Initialize enemy properties.
- `update_enemies()`: Update enemy positions and behaviors.
- `draw_enemies()`: Render enemies on the screen.
- `spawn_enemy()`: Create new enemy instances.
- `enemy_collisions()`: Handle collisions with the player and their projectiles.

### 4. Fuel Depot Module
**Description**: Manages fuel depots, including their spawning, collisions, and interactions with the player.

**Features**:
- **Fuel Collection**: Replenish the player's fuel when flying over depots.
- **Fuel Destruction**: Allow depots to be destroyed by shooting.

**Functions**:
- `init_fuel_depots()`: Initialize fuel depot properties.
- `update_fuel_depots()`: Update fuel depot positions.
- `draw_fuel_depots()`: Render fuel depots on the screen.
- `check_fuel_collisions()`: Handle collisions with the player and projectiles.

### 5. UI Module
**Description**: Manages the game's user interface, including the life counter, score, and fuel gauge.

**Features**:
- **Life Counter**: Display the remaining lives of the player.
- **Score Display**: Show the player's current score.
- **Fuel Gauge**: Visual representation of the remaining fuel.

**Functions**:
- `init_ui()`: Initialize UI elements.
- `update_ui()`: Update UI elements based on game state.
- `draw_ui()`: Render the UI on the screen.

### 6. Procedural Generation Module (Stretch Goal)
**Description**: Dynamically generate levels on the fly for an infinite game experience.

**Features**:
- **Dynamic Level Creation**: Create new level segments as the player progresses.
- **Seed Management**: Use a fixed seed for consistent procedural generation.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase the difficulty as the player advances.

**Functions**:
- `init_procedural_generation()`: Initialize settings for procedural generation.
- `generate_next_segment()`: Create the next segment of the level.
- `scale_difficulty()`: Adjust the difficulty based on player progress.

### 7. Particle Effects Module (Stretch Goal)
**Description**: Add particle effects for explosions and other visual enhancements.

**Features**:
- **Explosion Effects**: Create particle effects for explosions when enemies or bridges are destroyed.
- **Visual Enhancements**: Add other particle effects for visual appeal.

**Functions**:
- `init_particles()`: Initialize particle settings.
- `update_particles()`: Update particle effects.
- `draw_particles()`: Render particle effects on the screen.
- `create_explosion()`: Trigger an explosion effect.

### Integration and Game Loop
The main game loop will integrate these modules, ensuring they interact seamlessly to provide a cohesive game experience.

**Main Game Loop Functions**:
- `init_game()`: Initialize all game modules.
- `update_game()`: Update all game modules each frame.
- `draw_game()`: Render all game modules each frame.
- `handle_input()`: Manage player input.

This modular approach ensures that each aspect of the game is handled independently, making the development process more manageable and organized.
